# Publishing packages

Prior to publishing, make sure to review the `pubspec.yaml`, `README.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md` files
to make sure their content is complete and correct.

Next, run the dry-run command to see if everything passes analysis:

    pub publish --dry-run


Finally, run the actual publish command:

    pub publish
